# ParallelFEM-Fortran
Parallel programming for Finite Element Analysis using FORTRAN and PETSc

This code includes several parallel implementations for the Lapalace equation and linear elasticity in 2D and 3D. This code has been tested on HPC machines at Swansea University.

I will upload a few more input files soon.

Please report if you find any issues/bugs.
